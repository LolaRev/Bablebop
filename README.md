Bablebop is a smartphone and human interaction game in which the players must select who will be the next ruler of the planet.

## Game story

The character you got belongs to a tiny planet called Bablebop. This planet is home to three different species: The Blobs, the Blarks and the Blims. For centuries these three species have fought each other in deadly wars to determine who will reign the planet. Millions and millions died for the cause, bringing nothing but suffering and pain. For this reason, just a decade ago, they decided to put an end to their terrible past. Every 10 years they use technology and their convincing skills to decide who will rule Bablebop for the next decade. Today is election day, you have 4 minutes to decide who will rule your planet. The elected ruler will be the one who collects the most Crowns. If you don’t trust someone you can always give them dirt instead of a Crown, your vote is secret so you won’t face any consequences.
You don’t know who is who, give crowns to those who convince you and dirt to those you don’t trust.
Let the election begin!
